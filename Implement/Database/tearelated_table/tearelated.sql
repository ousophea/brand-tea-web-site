In one study at the University of Texas, green-tea extract was given to patients with precancerous lesions in their mouths, and <strong>it slowed the progression to oral cancer</strong>. Animal studies have also found that tea compounds can inhibit cancer growth.</p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #33cccc;\">5. Better breath</span></h3>\r\n<p>Green tea has been associated with better-smelling breath. Why? Likely because it <strong>kills the microbes that make our mouths stinky.</strong> The University of British Columbia&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.dentistry.ubc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Faculty of Dentistry</a> measured the level of smelly compounds in people&rsquo;s mouths after they were given green-tea powder or another substance that supposedly helps with <a href=\"http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/oral-health/top-10-causes-of-bad-breath\">bad breath</a>. <strong>Green tea outperformed mints, chewing gum and even parsley-seed oil in this study.</strong></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #33cccc;\">Tips for drinking green tea</span></h3>\r\n<p>Want your daily diet to include more greens &ndash; green tea, that is? It&rsquo;s likely safe to consume up to five cups a day of the stuff. But to get the maximum health and flavour benefits, make sure you <strong>prep your tea properly</strong>. Prepare a ceramic teapot by warming it with hot water. For the tea, use fresh, cold water, filtered or from a spring, if possible, instead of the tap. After bringing the water to a boil, let it cool for three minutes. Then pour it over tea leaves or a teabag and let it steep, covered, for three more minutes.</p>\r\n<p>Think your teeth are set because you&rsquo;re already drinking black tea? Keep in mind that since black tea is more processed, it contains less antioxidants and beneficial plant chemical compounds than green tea. Black tea is also two to three times higher in caffeine, so it&rsquo;s more likely to cause side effects such as nervousness and sleep disturbances. Caffeine can also interfere with some medications &ndash; ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not a tea drinker, <strong>try oral care products that contain green tea</strong>, such as toothpaste and mouthwash (look for these at natural health stores). You can even chew gum or suck on candies made with green tea (as long as they&rsquo;re sugarless!). But if you do enjoy tea, it makes sense to reach for green the next time you&rsquo;re turning on the kettle</p>', '1', '1');
